                                        <br>As you might be aware, PHP is the most widely used programming language that is used for backend server-side development, but choosing the best framework of PHP for web application development for the business is the most difficult task as there are so many options available. Here in this blog, you’ll know why the Laravel framework is the best framework of PHP for web app development.
                                        <br>Laravel framework is one of the best open-source frameworks of PHP. Its architectural patterns are especially based on Symfony. It performs far better than other PHP frameworks because of its advanced features like Command Line Interface called Artisan, Support for the Database system, and migrations. Its advanced development tools facilitate rapid web application development. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Laravel Framework is known to work on the MVC architecture, which represents Model View Controller. It is exceptionally easy when the developers use it and offers a base to design productively functioning small to huge business applications.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>When there are big projects with more than five files, web artisans can organize them effectively which gives a great deal of practicality for the project. As the developers work on a big project, the code can in any case go haywire and lose its structure.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Laravel’s first stable version was released in June 2011 and the latest Laravel version is version 8, which was released on September 8, 2020, with new features like Laravel Jetstream, model factory classes, & migration squashing, etc.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Laravel is the most popular framework of PHP used for business applications, According to Google Trends, Laravel secured the highest score in recent years compared to other PHP frameworks.

                                        <br>Why Laravel is the best framework for PHP?
                                        <br>As we know PHP is the best choice for web development, we have built n number of websites on the PHP Laravel framework for our client and they found it super amazing, here we point out some of the interesting features of the Laravel framework here, which will explain why it is gaining so much popularity and has become the best framework of PHP.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Laravel framework-best framework of PHP
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4>

                                            1. The Model-View-Controller architectural pattern support
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>The first and quite possibly the most basic advantage that makes the Laravel more popular among all other PHP frameworks is that it follows the best development practices. The use of the Model-View-Controller-based programming configuration design is a decent a valid example.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>The model-view-controller (MVC) architectural design, in any case, guarantees clarity between logic(Model) and presentation (View) through the perspective of the Controller, which brings results in overall proper functioning and performance improvement, better documentation coherence, and then some.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>There are a number of outstanding built-in functions includes in the model-view-controller pattern like- complete authentication system, Eloquent ORM (Object Relational Mapping), streamlined database migration, and pagination. Subsequently, for instance, MVC permits rapidly discovering documents in their logical directories even when you work on a large software project or easily interacting with databases with the help of Eloquent ORM. With MVC, a PHP developer can oversee how a specific web application introduces itself in reality and afterward further develop it in like manner.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                            2. Authentication and Authorization
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>This feature allows site owners to quickly include and enable authentication and approval and altogether streamline the utilization of validation. Architects would now have the option to give striking solutions to their help.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                            3. Packaging System
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>A packaging system helps the web application to automate the procedure through there multiple support software or libraries. Laravel framework uses a composer as a dependency manager, which manages all the information needed to manage packages. Packages are an incredible method to speed up development is to provide the functionality we need out of the box. Image, Laravel Debug bar, and Laravel IDE assistant are the absolute best Laravel packages.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                            4. Multiple File System
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>Laravel likewise has implicit help for the Cloud storage system, for example, Amazon S3 and Rack space Cloud Storage and obviously for local storage. It's incredibly easy to switch between these storage alternatives as the API stays as before for every system. One can utilize each of the three systems in one application to serve files from multiple locations like in a distributed environment.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                            5. Artisan Console
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>One of the most beneficial features of the Laravel framework is its capability to automate the task. Laravel comes up with a command-line interface Artisan that enables you to use task automation commands. Developers can create their artisan commands, which may be task-specific or customized.
                                        <br>The Artisan comes up with higher flexibility which provides several commands that you can use for regular tasks. They cover tasks such as database migration, the creation of a database seeder, model creation, and the creation of a controller.
                                        <br>

                                        <h4>

                                            6. Eloquent ORM
                                        </h4>
                                        <br>Laravel accompanies Models that empower the developers to improve the performance of the application being developed. These models can be customized utilizing Eloquent ORM. Laravel is the only PHP framework that offers features like customization with Eloquent ORM.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper. It is intelligible in that it offers to keep up with easy interaction with the application database objects through eloquent syntax.
